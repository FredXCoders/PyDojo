#CoderDojo Sushi
This is a technique for teaching one small bite at a time (kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Sushi)

The beginner sushi cards are to help teach the basics of the language... **Python** while also introducing programming
concepts like expressions, encapsulation, loops, branching, etc.

##Sushi Cards
<hr>
* **Python Interpreter** - What is an interpreter?  What can I do with it?  Why do I need it?  Answer these questions and more!
This one should be the starting point.
* **Expressions** - Expressions get things done.  Step two in the process.
